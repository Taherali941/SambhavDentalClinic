    content: `Teeth whitening is one of the most popular cosmetic dental treatments. Many patients ask us about safe ways to whiten teeth at home. Here's what our dental experts recommend:

**1. Whitening Toothpaste**
Use an ADA-approved whitening toothpaste that contains mild abrasives and peroxide to remove surface stains gently.

**2. Baking Soda**
A natural whitening agent, baking soda can be used occasionally to polish teeth. Mix with water to form a paste and brush gently.

**3. Professional Take-Home Kits**
The most effective option - custom trays from your dentist with professional-grade whitening gel provide consistent, safe results.

**What to Avoid:**
- Charcoal-based products (too abrasive)
- Lemon juice (erodes enamel)
- Excessive use of any whitening product

For best results, consult with Dr. Priyanka Kaushal at Sambhav Dental Clinic for a personalized whitening plan.`,

    content: `One of the most common fears patients have is about root canal treatment. Let's debunk the myths:

**The Reality:**
Modern root canal treatment is virtually painless! With today's advanced anesthesia and techniques, most patients report the procedure feels similar to getting a filling.

**Why Root Canals Are Necessary:**
- Save severely infected teeth
- Prevent spread of infection
- Eliminate tooth pain caused by infection

**What to Expect:**
1. Local anesthesia numbs the area completely
2. The infected pulp is removed
3. The tooth is cleaned and sealed
4. A crown protects the restored tooth

**Pain After Treatment:**
Some mild discomfort for 2-3 days is normal and easily managed with over-the-counter pain medication.

At Sambhav Dental Clinic, Dr. Priyanka Kaushal uses the latest techniques for comfortable, painless root canal treatment.`,
